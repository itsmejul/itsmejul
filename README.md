## Hi there 👋

🔥 I'm Julian, a final-year computer science student from Germany.
🤖 I'm especially interested in all things Python and machine learning.
⚠️ Currently, I'm exploring how to make LLMs more reliable by researching token distributions for my thesis and a research project.
🍪 What I'm also curious about is the intersection between semiconductor technology and AI.
